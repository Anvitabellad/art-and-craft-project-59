<p id= "para"> I love doing Art and Craft, it is one of my favourite things to do. In my free time I either draw are do some Origami. I also have a youtube Channel on the Art and craft I do. It is so fun to do. Recently I have been doing a lot of them, as I stay at home all day. Plus, now I have Dussehra holidays for 2 weeks. Thus, I'll do more and more of them. The most recent one which i did were DIY Wall Hanging, A cloud pen holder and a box Painting.
